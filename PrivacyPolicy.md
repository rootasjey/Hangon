# Hangon - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to me and I respect it.

* I don't share your personal information with anyone

* I don't store your personal information at all

## Personal folders

Hangon accesses your personal pictures folders only to save/download 
new photos from Hangon to your device.

Each time photos are saved to your device, you have to trigger the action of download, 
and this process is never done in background without your consent.

Hangon doesn't send any information to any third-party entity, firm, service.

The app doesn't collect or save data for later use.

All the code is open source and can be reviewed.

You can verify what I do with your data by visiting the [source code](https://github.com/rootasjey/Feels).
